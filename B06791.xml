            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179289:10"/>the King, the Parliament it ſelf, and three Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>The King in the beginning of this Parliament, had for the ſecurity of the Subjects in their Perſons, Liberties, and Eſtates, paſſed many and ſeveral Acts of grace, (to the no ſmall dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of his Royal Prerogative) more than all his Predeceſſors Kings of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> from the Conqueſt downward, had ever done; and all this to remove from them all jealouſies and fears.</p>
                  <p>After this in <hi>May,</hi>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">1641.</note> 1641. he gives way at the great and preſſing importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Houſe of Commons, to the Condemnation and Execution of the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> a loyal Subject, and a moſt able and accompliſh'd coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, as any Prince in <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> ever had. The King was very hardly moved to yield either to his attaindor or execution, as not being ſatisfied in conſcience, of any guilt or crime in him, deſerving ſuch puniſhment; but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179289:10"/>yield at length he did (though with much reluctancy) to ſatisfie the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity or the people, and indeed at the requeſt of the Earle himſelf; who deſired <hi>Jonah</hi>-like, <hi>to be caſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,</hi> thereby to appeaſe the violent rage of a tempeſtuous people. The truth is, this Nobleman, as alſo the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (afterwards <hi>Anno</hi> 1644.) were meerly ſacrificed to the malice and revenge of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the King goes into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to compoſe differences there, between himſelf and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Kingdom: which done, he returns again to <hi>London,</hi> and is there received with exceeding joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of the people, in or about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>December.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Houſe of Commons to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Majeſty home, inſtead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him thanks for the many gracious Acts he had lately paſſed, they preſent him with a Remonſtrance, <hi>Dec.</hi> 15.

                  <p>After the publiſhing of this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, fears and jealouſies encreaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people; the vulgar rabble in and about <hi>London,</hi> frequently flock down to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with Petitions and clamours, againſt the Biſhops and Popiſh Lords, and diſaffected Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (as they termed them) in the Houſe of Commons, and no redreſs could be had againſt them, though the Houſe of Lords and the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had moved the Houſe of Commons to declare againſt them. The truth is, they were favored and countenanced
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179289:11"/>under hand, by ſome Members of that Houſe.</p>
                  <p>The King to avoid the danger of theſe tumults, withdraws from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> to <hi>Windſor;</hi> from thence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and ſo by <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> into the Northern parts; and thence to <hi>York.</hi>

                  <p>The Parliament ſoon after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> petition Him, at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and elſewhere, for the Militia, to have it put into ſuch hands as the two Houſes ſhall think fit; but he denyes them: telling them that the Law hath ſetled it in Him; that to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Himſelf of the power of the Sword, is to bereave Himſelf of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to protect his people, and ſupport the Laws. This Petition was much inſiſted on by the Parliament under pretence of feares and jealouſies; but the King abſolutely and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This by the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is Voted a levying of War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament, though they themſelves had long before, three times as many of the <hi>Trainedbands</hi> of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to guard the houſes dayly.</p>
                  <p>Many Petitions, Anſwers, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, paſſed between the King and Parliament, during his Majeſties being at <hi>York,</hi> wherein it is evident to all underſtanding men, that the King had the better cauſe, and was more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain it by the pen, and by reaſons and arguments, than the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179289:12"/>was; for the truth is, his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and Anſwers to their Meſſages, Petitions, and Propoſitions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>But words and writings not being ſufficient to compoſe theſe differences, they proceed from words to blows: About <hi>July,</hi> they Vote that the King is ſeduced by evill and Malignant Counſellers, and thereupon they Vote an Army to be raiſed under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Robert Earle</hi> of <hi>Eſsex;</hi> the pretence is for King and Parliament, againſt theſe Malignant Counſellers; but they accuſe or name none in particular.</p>

A ſore fight there was in the night, with much loſs to both parties: The King gains the Town, and the next day, or the day after, takes his Ordnance, and Ammunition from <hi>Dennington Caſtle</hi> in the ſight of the Enemy, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and ſo marches with them to <hi>Oxford.</hi> This Sommers ſervice loſt the credit of <hi>Eſsex, Mancheſter,</hi> and <hi>VValler,</hi> they were never imployed after.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean time, while <hi>Eſsex</hi> and <hi>VValler</hi> were thus imployed againſt the King, the <hi>Scots</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the Aſſociated Counties, and other of the Parliaments Forces, had ſo far prevailed againſt the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>

At <hi>Naſeby</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> the two Armies meet on Saturday, <hi>June</hi> 14. where at the firſt encounter the King had much the better, his Right Wing of horſemen Defeating and Routing the Left Wing of the Parliaments Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, wounding <hi>Skippon,</hi> and taking <hi>Ireton</hi> (<hi>Cromwels</hi> ſon in law) priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

                  <p>This ſummer the Wars being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, all Garriſons ſurrendred, and the Kings Forces utterly ſubdued, and forced to compound for their eſtates, taking an Oath never to bear Arms againſt the Parliament, they take a reſolution to disband the Army, ſending ſome part of it into <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſtill in Arms there, and only to keep 5000 Horſe and Foot in <hi>England,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace of the Kingdome, againſt any riſings that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
                  <p>The ſouldiers fearing the Wars would ceaſe, and their trade decay, began to Mutinie; firſt they pick quarrels againſt the Parliament, and at once impeach eleven of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Commons, all

                  <p>The Army removes to ſeveral quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the King along with them.

                     <hi>May</hi> 4. 1647. in the hands of ſuch of the City, as the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Common Council, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and approved: The Army about the 20 of <hi>July,</hi> require of the Parliament, that Ordinance may be repealed, and the <hi>Militia</hi> of the City ſettled in other hands, ſuch as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might confide in; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a thin houſe, the <hi>Militia</hi> was changed, without any Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſons formerly intruſted, or acquainting the Mayor or Common Council with it, to hear what they could alledge in their own behalf.

                  <p>The Houſe of Lords upon preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Petitions, were pleaſed to grant their deſires, revoking the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the 23 of <hi>July,</hi> and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that of the fourth of <hi>May.</hi> The debate ſtuck longer in the Houſe of Commons, but about three of the clock in the Afternoon, they paſſed it; The Apprentices ſtaying in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment door, till the Vote was paſſed; and then all or the moſt part withdrew and went to their homes.</p>
                  <p>The Apprentices being departed, ſome diſorderly perſons inſtigated thereunto (as was probably thought)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179289:23"/>by divers Sectaries and Adherents to the Army, to make the buſineſs more odious, and to give the Army occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to quarrel with the City, flock'd again to the Parliament door; and the Speaker having adjourned the Houſe, the chaire, and there kept both him they compelled him again to return to the Members in the Houſe, till they had paſſed a Vote, that the King ſhould come to <hi>London</hi> to treat.</p>
                  <p>The Mayor and Common Council ſtill aſſembled, hearing of this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſent down the Sheriffs immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſuch ſtrength as they could for the preſent get, and pacified the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, ſending the Speaker ſafe to his houſe; and publiſhed Edicts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like.

                  <p>On the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following, the day before they were to meet upon the adjournment, the Speaker with about fourty of the Members, ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to the Army then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> complaining of an horrid force put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Houſe.

                  <p>Theſe things thus paſſed at <hi>London</hi> between the Parliament and City, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incenſed the Army, who now take upon them, to be Supream Umpires o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Nation; they entertain and countenance the fugitive Speakers and Members, and they and the Council of the Army, ſet together in conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, engaging to ſupport one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this quarrel againſt the members (as they termed them) at <hi>Weſtminiſter,</hi> and the City.</p>

                  <p>The City thus prepared for defence, were nevertheleſs, for preventing the effuſion of blood, willing to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with the Army upon any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms; and to that purpoſe ſent ſeveral meſſages to the Army; but all would not do, no terms of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation or peace would be granted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would ſubmit themſelves, and the Parliament, wholly to the power of the Army; which upon the point they did; for in concluſion they agree and yield, To deſert both Houſes of Parliament and the impeached Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179289:25"/>To recall their Declaration late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed, Relinquiſh their <hi>Militia,</hi> deliver up all their Forts and line of Communication to the Army, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> with all Armes and Ammunition therein; to disband all their Forces, and turn all their new-made Commanders and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formadoes out of the line, to demoliſh all their works, and to ſuffer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to march without oppoſition through the City.</p>
                  <p>Theſe imperious conditions of the Army, were calmly ſubmitted to by the tame-ſpirited <hi>Citizens:</hi> And thereupon, the Army brings in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive Speakers and Members, and ſeat them again in their authority; <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> receives the ſolemn thanks of the Houſe, the common ſouldiers two months pay for their good ſervice and valour, and a day of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is appointed, to be ſolemnly kept for this great deliverance: and <hi>Fairfax</hi> made General of all Forces, both in

                     <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and Conſtable of the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> All this was done, <hi>Aug.</hi> 6. 1647.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the General, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, and the whole Army, with their train of Artillery, march in triumph through the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> And from that day forward, both City, Parliament, and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are ſubject to the Army.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the reſtitution of theſe fugitive Members, all Votes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Ordinances of Parliament, made in their abſence, are declared null and void: The eleven impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, have leave granted them to go beyond Sea, and they muſt think they are favourably dealt with: Seven Lords that ſate in the upper Houſe, in the abſence of the fugitive Members, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Suffolk, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Midleſex;</hi> the Lords <hi>Berkly, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby, Hunſdon,</hi> and <hi>Maynard,</hi> are impeached of high Treaſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179289:26"/>to the black Rod, for levying of War againſt the King, Parliament, and Kingdom. The Lord Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, and divers Citizens, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impeached of the ſame crime, and committed to the Tower; divers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers alſo of the Commons Houſe, are under accuſation and examination, as countenancers and abettors of the late tumult. But all theſe impeachments and accuſations, in time vaniſhed, and came to nothing; only the Army Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was by this means ſtrengthened and encouraged, and the other party as much quell'd and diſcouraged; ſo that thenceforward all Votes propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were paſſed or not, according to the temper and diſpoſition of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Parliament became wholly ſubſervient to the Armies deſigns, as will plainly appeare in the enſuing Story.</p>
                  <p>Meantime the King continues ſtill under the power of the Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves and paſſes from place to place
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:179289:27"/>as they remove their Quarters: But now having made the Parliament wholly for their turn, he is removed nearer <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Hampton Court:</hi> there he had much freedom, and abundance of people continually reſorted to him. At <hi>Hampton Court</hi> he receives Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions from the Parliament, <hi>Septem.</hi> 7. the ſame in effect that were tendred to him at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in <hi>July</hi> the year before. The King in anſwer, deſires that the Parliament would take into conſideration the Propoſals of the Army, of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. 1647. as more moderate, and more conducing to ſatisfie all intereſts in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>The Parliament being thus turned out, <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Army Officers take upon them the government of the Nation: They preſently impoſe ſix Months Tax, and erect a new Council of State, (<hi>Bradſhaw</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for his good ſervice was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, is now not ſo much as a Member of the Council.) <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſoon after cals a Convention, of about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty perſons, pickt out by himſelf, out of the ſeveral Counties of the Nation, moſt of them inferiour

                  <p>Thus being ſeated in Authority, they make an Act for ſix Months Tax, at the old rate of 120000 li. a Month; and another Act concerning marriages, appointing Juſtices of Peace to marry, and none other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages to be valid or lawful: In the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:179289:43"/>ſame Act, they ordain a Regiſter to be kept in every Pariſh, in which is to be ſet down all births and burials, not ſo much as mentioning Baptiſm, as a thing in their opinion at leaſt not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: thus they leſſen and diminiſh the uſe and authority of Miniſters, whom they intended by degrees, to take wholly away.</p>
                  <p>In order whereunto, they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to take a way Tithes; but the Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> being called to alledge what might be ſaid in defence of them, by their Counſel learned in the Law, and by Arguments out of Scripture, they oppoſed ſo ſtrongly, as that debate was laid aſide for the preſent. But that failing, they had another device, namely by an Act, in one day, to have unbottomed all Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> and to have lockt up the Church doors, (as ſome affirmed) and then afterward, to have taken in whom they had thought good, which may probably be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:179289:43"/>ſhould have been only ſuch as would have renounced their orders, if not their baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Things being carried ſo high and in ſuch a frantick manner, the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate among them weary of the work, and fearing they ſhould rather bring things into further confuſion, then ſettle any thing, they repair to <hi>Cromwel</hi> the General, deſiring him to take again into his hands his Writing or conveyance of the ſupream power; whereupon he preſently diſſolves them: but ſome of the Anabaptiſts refuſing to obey, and continuing ſtill in the houſe at their prayers, he ſent Souldiers who pulled them out, and lockt up the doors againſt them <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb.</hi> 12. 1653.</p>

They would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have made him Protector, but they would not allow of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Government in all things.</p>
                  <p>Ye muſt know by the way, that one Article of the Government was that the Parliament called and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, muſt ſit five months (if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves think good) and during that time, the Protector had not power to diſſolve them; but afterwards at any time he might: It was further ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that whatſoever Acts they made and tendred to him, if he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent within thirty dayes, or ſatisfie them to the contrary, they were to be Laws valid and binding, without
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:179289:46"/>him. To conclude, they ſpent ſo long time in tuning the inſtrument, that juſt at the five moneths end (counting preciſely twenty eight dayes to a moneth) the Protector calls them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, tells them he thought they had been aſleep, having not of a long time heard from them; That they had ſate long and done nothing, and therefore tells them they may repaire every one to his ſeveral home. Thus they are diſſolved with a kind of jeer, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 22. 1654.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt tell you, the Parliament would not tender him any Bill to paſſe, nor receive any Laws from him, till ſuch time as they had regulated the Government of the Nation, and confirmed his authority upon him. The truth is, they thought him not to have power to enact Laws, till themſelves had given it him: And therefore they would have nothing paſs, till alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether were done and finiſhed.</p>

                  <p>About the begining of the next ſpring,<note place="margin" type="runSum">1657.</note> there is a project ſet on foot by ſome in the Houſe for making the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector King: Firſt a petition or remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance from many of the City deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, was preſented by an Alderman of <hi>London</hi> to the Speaker, ſealed up in a box. Afterwards a Bill is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it: the Houſe are very forward in the buſineſs; only the Protectors pleaſure is not known. They very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ſolemnly petition his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to accept of it; as an honor not only merited by himſelf, but much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the ſettlement of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>Mean time the <hi>Independents</hi> and Factious people faſt and pray, to avert the judgment that is like to fall upon them, in having a King. Some great Commanders in the Army, and many

It is more then probable, the Protector himſelf thirſted after it, and that the deſigne was firſt hammered in his own forge; for <hi>Thurloe</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary openly promoted it, and (as it was ſaid) brought in the Bill. But when the Parliament made their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond addreſs to him, he modeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, yet he gave them thanks for their good affections to him.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament ſat from the 17. of <hi>September,</hi> to the 26. of <hi>June.</hi> And then by an Act entituled <hi>The humble Petition and advice,</hi> they conſtitute him Protector, and give him power to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his Succeſſor, which was all one as to eſtabliſh the Government in his Family: They erect another Houſe of Parliament, in place of the Lords, for which they could invent no other name, but <hi>The Other Houſe.</hi> It was

                  </p>
                  <p>Further in that Act, they limit him ſo far, as not to impoſe any Tax or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the People, without their conſent in Parliament; and in lieu thereof, they give him 35000 li. a month by way of Tax for three years

                  <p>But in the mean time ſoon after their adjournment, the Protector Caſhiers <hi>Lambert</hi> his Leiuetenant-General, and <hi>Hacker</hi> Colonel of his life-guard, and ſome other Officers of his Army, who were conceived to be averſe to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of his Kingſhip; which gave men cauſe to conclude, that he ſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This dream he tells to his fellow ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes, and by that meanes it came to his Maſters eare, who laſhed him ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it. How near the former part of his dream was fulfilled, appears by this ſtory; and how juſtly he deſerved the latter part, I leave it to others to judge?</p>
                  <p>Againſt the meeting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by adjournment, he ſends out his Writ, for ſummoning the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his other Houſe.

There is a Catalogue extant of them all, and therefore it is needleſs to repeat them.</p>
                  <p>When the time came according to the Adjournment, <hi>January</hi> 20. the Nobility though called, diſdained to appear: Many of the Gentry abſented themſelves, yet ſome of all ſorts (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only the Nobility) enough to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:179289:52"/>make a competent number, appeared. Some that were called to his other Houſe, were elected for the Houſe of Commons, and choſe that place, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the other Houſe; Sir <hi>Arthur Haſelrig</hi> (always an enemy to the King, and no friend to the Protector) was one of the number: The Houſe of Commons would by no means digeſt that other Houſe, nor own them; though ſome meſſages were ſent to them, yet would they not vouchſafe them any anſwer.</p>

                  <p>The Munday following, Mr. <hi>William Prin</hi> a Bencher of <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inn, and many more Members of the Long Parliament, that were ſecluded upon the Kings Tryal, <hi>December</hi> 1648, met together at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and went to the Houſe-door, demanding admiſſion to ſit with the reſt, but were denied entrance, and kept out with armed guards.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:179289:58"/>they were forcibly kept out, and very ſolidly pleads the Kings cauſe againſt their Commonwealth. And another Book he writes and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes at the ſame time, intituled, The good old Cauſe, wherein he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves, by twelve undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that that which they termed the good old Cauſe, was far worſe, more deſtructive both to Church and State, to Religion and the Common-wealth, then the Gunpowder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And though he openly owned and avowed theſe Books, ſetting his name to them, yet they never returned the leaſt anſwer to them, nor queſtioned the Author: But theſe Books thus ſeaſonably pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, gave a deadly blow to their good old Cauſe, though the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it was not ſo preſently diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

                  <p>The Parliament were more obliged to the Army, then they were to the people, for putting them again into Authority; for the people had had more then enough of them, for almoſt two ſeven years before. <hi>Oliver</hi> never did ſo much good for the Nation, nor had more thanks from the people, then when he and his Army had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe men out, as before is ſaid, <hi>April</hi> 20. 1653.

                  <p>This year about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> there was a riſing in <hi>Cheſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and the parts adjoyning, under the command of Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Midleton,</hi> and other Gentlemen in thoſe parts; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for a free and full Parliament to be elected by the People. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:179289:60"/>reported, the deſign was general, laid all over all <hi>England,</hi> and thus it was carried on chiefly by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Party.

                     </gap>ſt that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe; in other places attempts were made, but they were ſuppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> had taken <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> both Town and Caſtle, and was reported to be very numerous. And therefore upon the firſt intelligence thereof, <hi>Lambert</hi> is ſent out againſt him, with an Army of ſix or ſeven thouſand men, and a train of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and forces from all quarters are appointed to draw to him, ſo that all meeting, he had a very great Army. Sir <hi>George Booth</hi>'s party, ſeeing other Counties ſo ſlack, begin to faint and forſake him; <hi>Lambert</hi> marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, is oppoſed by ſome forces at a narrow paſs, but preſently all are routed, and Sir <hi>George</hi> himſelf, and ſome others are taken and brought priſoners to <hi>London:</hi> this hapned about <hi>Aug.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:179289:61"/>
                  <p>This deſign ſo ſtrongly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally (as was reported) laid, and ſo ſoon defeated and diſappointed the Parliament themſelves, and all men thought them cock-ſure. They begun to reſolve to ſubmit themſelves to the yoke of their old Task-maſters, ſeeing no other remedy; And the Parliament went on with their work, in ſetling the Nation in a Common-wealth way; intending after that was eſtabliſhed, to proceed ſeverely againſt Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and his party. They began already to ſequeſter his and other mens eſtates; for many they ſay were engaged in the plot, all over <hi>England:</hi> and the City of <hi>Weſtcheſter</hi> they quite diſ-franchiſed.</p>
                  <p>But obſerve what followed. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> and the Army were ſo heightened at this ſucceſs, and the Parliament (as they thought) ſo much obliged to them, for reſtoring them into their power, and preſerving them in it, as they thought whatſoever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179289:61"/>would not have been denied them. Thereupon in their return to <hi>London,</hi> they take a reſolution by una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent of the Officers and common Souldiers to require to have a General of their own Election, either <hi>Fleetwood</hi> or <hi>Lambert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parliament having intelligence hereof, reſolve the contrary; calling to mind, how ſix years before they had been ſerved by <hi>Oliver,</hi> who then was their General: and therefore they thought it not fit any more to intruſt ſo great a power in any one mans hand, leaſt he ſhould do as <hi>Oliver</hi> had done. And therefore they reſolve and vote, to put the power of the Army into the hands of ſeven Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereof about two or three (at moſt) were Army-men, and the reſt Members of the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>This Vote of theirs highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented the Army, and <hi>Lambert</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially; the buſineſs came to that height, as about the tenth or eleventh

                  <p>But the Parliament did prudently and ſtoutly in one thing; when they ſaw whereto they muſt, that the Army would turn them out, a day or two before (<hi>Octob.</hi> 11.) they made an Act preſently after printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, That it ſhould be high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in any, to impoſe, aſſeſs, collect, levy, or pay any Exciſe, Cuſtoms,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179289:62"/>Tunnage and Poundage, or any Taxe or Tallage whatſoever, from that 11th day of <hi>October,</hi> but what ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the conſent of the People themſelves in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>This was a ſtumbling-block to the Army-men; it hindred them ſomewhat from the raiſing of money for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but had things ſucceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their minde, they would ſoone have leapt over it, and raiſed what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament thus caſheerd by the Army, the next thing they do is to provide places for themſelves. <hi>Fleet-wood</hi> is made General, <hi>Lambert</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General, <hi>Desborough</hi> is made General of the horſe. And they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a place for <hi>Monck</hi> alſo, who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is Governour of <hi>Scotland;</hi> him they will make Major General of the foot. This for the Army.</p>
                  <p>For the government of the State they muſt take time to conſider of that. But ſome things they lay for grounds
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:179289:63"/>and principles. 1. They'l free th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> people of the burthen of Tythes (and in time perhaps of Miniſters too) that hath been a deſigne all along ſince the Army gave Law to the Nation. 2. They will perhaps have a kinde of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not of the choyce of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for the people (ſay they) are grown generally ſo corrupt, as they are not fit to chooſe their own repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; but muſt be left to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In ſtead of an Houſe of Lords they'l have a ſtanding Senate of Army Officers and ſuch like godly men, which ſhall have a Negative voice in all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary conſultations. Theſe and ſome others, as I concluded out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſome of their books, were their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, though much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation they had, and ſome progreſſe they made in framing a Government yet could they make no work of it, they could not agree of any. Only thus for the preſent exigence of affairs, the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:179289:63"/>eſtabliſh a Committee of Safety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting moſtly of Army-Officers, and ſome Members of the late Parliament, that ſince the diſſolution thereof, had ſided with the Army, whereof Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vane</hi> was one.</p>
                  <p>But that which ſpoyled the ſport, and gave check-mate to their new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Government, was a buſineſſe in <hi>Scotland. Monck</hi> (as I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) was governour of that Nation, and had been ſo in all theſe changes, almoſt ever ſince <hi>Oliver</hi> took upon him the Protectors place. They had provided <hi>Monck</hi> a place among them, (ſo courteous they were) but they were not ſo prudent as to conſult with him about breaking up the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And therefore upon the firſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of theſe things, <hi>Monck</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> declares againſt their proceedings. The ſouldiers here (without expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating) preſently arme againſt him; inſomuch as their forces are upon their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179289:64"/>march towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> and the parts thereabout, upon the 29th of <hi>October</hi> the Parliament having been broken up but bare ſixteen days before; <hi>Monck</hi> ſeeing them thus on the forehand with him, entertains them with a Treaty; Commiſſioners are appointed on both ſides, and furniſhed with inſtructions; mean time <hi>Monck</hi> takes and fortifies <hi>Barwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed.</hi> The newes comes that they are agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that both parties have unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly declared againſt the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> (ſo they commonly call the King) which cauſed much rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing amongſt the Armies adherents; but this ſoone after proved to be falſe: <hi>Monck</hi> at the return of his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, is not ſatisfied in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; Nevertheleſſe ſoone after, he deſires another Treaty, which was held at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> during which time he calls a Convention of the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who (as it was reported) not only approved this his undertaking, but aſſiſted him in it.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:179289:64"/>
                  <p>The Treaty at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> after ſome time ſpent therein, had no better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe than the former; They could not, or at leaſt wiſe <hi>Monck</hi> would not agree. But <hi>Fleetwood</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gives intelligence to his adherents in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that they were ſo farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that if they ſhould grant what <hi>Monck</hi> inſiſted upon, it would be no whit prejudicial to them.</p>

                  <p>In the meane time I muſt tell you, from <hi>Lambers</hi> firſt advancing againſt <hi>Monck,</hi> the <hi>Londoners</hi> had been ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and the reſt, to joyn with the Army; but they utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, though they liked well enough the turning out of the Parliament.

                  <p>VVhile theſe things were thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at <hi>London, Haſelrig</hi> and ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Officers, that from the firſt had adhered to the Parliament, got into <hi>Portſmouth</hi> about <hi>December</hi> the third; and there joyning with ſome chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Navy, declare openly for the Parliament againſt the Army; And becauſe the City of <hi>London</hi> would not joyne with them, (for they liked the Parliament as thus conſtituted, as ill as they did the Army) they with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Navy under the command of <hi>Lawſon</hi> then Admiral, (who had a little before deſerted the Army) block up the <hi>Thames;</hi> this was about a week before Chriſtmas.</p>

                  <p>But I muſt tell you, that before this, they had endeavoured what they might, in all the Counties, to raiſe money for the ſupply of the Army, but could not get any conſiderable ſums.

And this gave another advantage to the <hi>Rump</hi> to croud in.</p>
                  <p>Being got in as before is noted, The Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are yet jealous,

                  <p>And indeed within a few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they diſcovered their intentions; the <hi>Rump</hi> was ſo far from calling in the ſecluded Members, as they paſſed a Vote that never any of them ſhould ſit again: and in ſtead of filling up their Houſe by a new election, they are about contriving an Oath of abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereby to force men under a penalty to abjure the King and all the Royal Line or Family; but this Oath ſtuck long in debate, and at laſt would not paſſe amongſt themſelves.</p>

                  <p>On Wedneſday following, <hi>Febr.</hi> 8. The City continuing ſtill in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractorineſs and oppoſition to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they meet in Common-Council, and there paſs a Vote or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Not to pay or levy any Taxes, until ſuch time as they may have a full and free Parliament: For hitherto you muſt know, the <hi>Rump</hi> had not agreed upon qualifications for filling up the Houſe; and many thought they never intended it; but only to eſtabliſh themſelves in perpetual authority.</p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:179289:72"/>
                  <p>Upon this Vote or Reſolve of the Common-Council, the <hi>Rump</hi> are highly offended, and ſend a ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Monk</hi> to march the next day with his Army into the City; To pull up their chains and poſts, to break down the gates and portcullis of the City; to impriſon forwith in the Tower divers Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, that were conceived to be chiefly active in paſſing thoſe Votes. This command of theirs, <hi>Monk</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes next day, <hi>Febr.</hi> 9. to the great terror and amazement, not only of the City, but of the whole Nation and Kingdom, when they heard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it: All hearts are ſaddened, and now moſt men conclude, that <hi>Monk</hi> is not the man deſigned of God for the delivery of this oppreſſed Nation.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlemen in the ſeveral Counties that had ſubſcribed and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their Addreſſes and Declarations, begin now to fear their own Stakes; there being in ſome of their Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179289:72"/>expreſſions againſt paying taxes without a free Parliament: It had (I muſt tell alſo you) before this, been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Houſe, that thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that tendred theſe Addreſſes, might be ſequeſtred; yet at that time, it was carried in the Negative. They had cauſe to fear alſo, that if they intended at all to fill up the Houſe by new Elections, they would impoſe ſuch qualifications, as ſhould exclude all ſuch Gentlemen in all Counties, as either ſubſcribed or delivered theſe Addreſſes: and ſo the greateſt part by far of the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> would be made incapable of ſerving their Country, and conſequently the filling up of the Houſe by ſuch a choice, as would then be allowed, would be but a means further to enſlave both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Poſterities.</p>
                  <p>For theſe and the like conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they had ſome thoughts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions in moſt Counties (as it was reported) to ſecond their Addreſſes or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:179289:73"/>Declarations with Arms, thereby to vindicate their Native Rights from the oppreſſion of a Combination of Tyrants, who had a long time uſurped the ſupream power of the Nation, and were now perpetuating that uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the free-born people, to their utter ſlavery and oppreſſion. And it was verily conceived, that had not the face of affairs ſuddenly changed, by <hi>Monks</hi> unhooding himſelf, the whole Kingdom would ſoon have been put into a general flame of combuſtion: for the City of <hi>London,</hi> by this late af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, were rather incenſed than awed: though their Gates and Portculleſſes were broken, yet their hearts and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages remained entire, and were the more confirmed and hardened: and had the Counties unanimouſly riſen, it is like the <hi>Londoners</hi> would not have ſit ſtill: for the whole Kingdom was generally exaſperated againſt the <hi>Rump;</hi> and the diſperſed ſoulders of <hi>Lamberts</hi> Army, not knowing where
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:179289:73"/>to quarter, nor how to live, might probably be thought willing to adhere to any party, that were in a capacity to entertain them with pay.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> (as it is conceived) by putting <hi>Monk</hi> upon that baſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of being their City-Scavenger, had a deſign not only to terrifie and curb the City, but alſo to make <hi>Monk</hi> and his Army odious and irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, whereby they might engage him hereafter more firmly to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monk</hi> having thus executed the Commands of the <hi>Rump,</hi> he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his mind at it. And upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday following, <hi>Febr.</hi> 11. he draws his Army into <hi>Finsbury</hi> Fields, and ſending for the Lord Mayor and ſome of the chief Citizens, he had ſome diſcourſe with them: And preſently after, he writes a Letter to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as from <hi>White-hall,</hi> wherein he tels them, that he had done their commands, though not without ſome
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:179289:74"/>regret; never any ſuch thing having in all theſe late troubles, been done to that City, ſo eminent for the aſſiſtance and adherency to Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; He minded them, that the end of his coming and firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, as appears in his Declaration, was not only to preſerve them in their preſent power, but to vindicate the liberties and priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the Native rights and freedom of the people; That he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that ſome perſons impeached of high Treaſon, were yet ſuffered to ſit in the Houſe: That <hi>Lambert,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and others, perſons of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous principles, and highly guilty of the late diſſention of the Army, and of the horrid force put upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, were yet ſuffered to be in and about the City: That though they had voted the continuance of the ſetled maintenance of Miniſters, yet they were now upon contriving of another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement that would force many of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:179289:74"/>moſt conſcientious of them, from the enjoyment of their Means: That there had been too many oaths already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the Nation, and that they had more need to mourn for the breach of oaths, than to impoſe new ones. And that he obſerved, that thoſe men were moſt forward to impoſe oaths, who made leaſt conſcience of keeping them: He minded them alſo of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of dangerous conſequence, that they had lately received and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced from the <hi>Fanatick</hi> party. Theſe and ſome other grievances he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, and then adds his humble deſires, that they would by Friday following iſſue out Writs for filling up their Houſe by new Elections, with due and reaſonable qualifications; And that they would put a certain and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy period to their preſent ſitting, whereby the People may enjoy the benefit of ſucceſſive Parliaments, which is (ſaith he) the undoubted right of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. And in

To this effect (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) was his Letter ſigned by himſelf and the chief Officers of his Army, as from <hi>White-hall, Febr.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>This highly pleaſed and rejoyced the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and made full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the former rigidity done them: <hi>Monk</hi> herein granting the full of what they formerly deſired or expected from him. It was as great cauſe of joy to the whole Kingdom, as to the City. All that Saturday afternoon, there was Ringing, and Bonefires, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing, till twelve of the clock at night, and feaſting <hi>Monks</hi> Officers and Souldiers with wine and good chear; nothing was too dear for them At <hi>Norwich</hi> and in all places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at the firſt report of the News, there was the like rejoycing and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, in hope of a free Parliament. So much was the <hi>Rump</hi> in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:179289:75"/>of the people, as they deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to be rid of them.</p>
                  <p>Soon after <hi>Monk</hi> had thus decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf, and joyned with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and whole Kingdom in their juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, The ſecluded Members (who a great many of them had been all this time in and about <hi>London</hi>) addreſſed themſelves to him: he deſires a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be had between them and ſome of the <hi>Rump:</hi> they meet ten in number of either ſide, to argue and debate the buſineſs: One challenging admiſſion as Members of the Houſe, and unjuſtly before excluded: the other refuſing to admit them, unleſs they will confirm all that was done ſince their excluſion as juſt and lawful, or at leaſtwiſe engage (as themſelves had done) againſt a ſingle Perſon or Houſe of Lords.
